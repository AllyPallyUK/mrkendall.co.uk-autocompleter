# mrkendall.co.uk-autocompleter
A python script that automagically completes any mrkendall.co.uk task that has a "hint" button on it!

## How To Use

Run the script anywhere you want, then click on the mrkendall.co.uk tab so that it's focused

Wait until the program has finished

swipe your cursor up to the TOP RIGHT of the screen to stop the automation



## But There Are Tasks That Don't Have A Hint Button!

Do it yourself



## I feel bad for using this to cheat on my homework, do you have any advice?

you should feel bad, you're giving up on french by using this, but at the same time...it's french.
